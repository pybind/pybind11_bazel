    This can be directly used in Python with the import statement.
    Assuming the name NAME, the following targets will be defined:
    1. NAME.so - the shared/dynamic library for the extension module
    2. NAME.pyd - a copy of NAME.so named for Python on Windows; see
                    https://github.com/pybind/pybind11_bazel/issues/74
    3. NAME - an alias pointing to either NAME.so or NAME.pyd as per
                the platform OS (not-Windows or Windows, respectively)
    Generally, the user will "depend" on this extension module via the
    data attribute of their py_* target; specifying NAME is preferred.
